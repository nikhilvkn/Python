#Disk Check Program

This is one of the common task to check the disk space of list of servers and do certain jobs with the gather result. Here, I
have created program which will,
1) Check the disk usage, print that one nicely to the terminal
2) Check and write the usage to a file and this result is pushed to a Slack Channel. How cool is that:wink:

Added both programs in this repository.
